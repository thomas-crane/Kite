## About

Kite is a fork of KRelay which targets the .NET Core runtime.

There are a few major differences between Kite and KRelay:

+ Kite is cross-platform. It can run on Windows, MacOS and Linux.
+ It runs in the console instead of using a GUI.

Aside from these differences, Kite is just a fork of KRelay, so it works in exactly the same way.

## Install

1. Download [.NET Core 2.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2).
2. Download the [latest Kite release](https://github.com/thomas-crane/Kite/releases) for your operating system.
3. Download and run [Ninjin's XML Grabber](https://www.mpgh.net/forum/showthread.php?t=1342936). You should download all of the available XMLs.
4. When the XML Grabber is finished, put the XML files in the same folder as the Kite executable.
5. Run Kite.
